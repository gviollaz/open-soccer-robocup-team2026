# Code Review — 2025 Season

## Post-Verification Status (Feb 21, 2026)

This original list of 8 bugs was expanded to **25 failure points** in the complete architecture document.
The cross-verification against real source code confirmed the majority and added new findings.

See updated documents:
- **[Complete architecture (verified)](2026-02-21-system-architecture-2025.md)** — 23 failure points + 3 new, with verification status
- **[Cross-verification analysis](2026-02-21-cross-verification-hypothesis-analysis.md)** — methodology and detailed results
- **[Revised priority map](2026-02-21-priority-map-revised.md)** — P0-P3 action plan
