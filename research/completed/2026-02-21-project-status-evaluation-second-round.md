# Project Status Evaluation (Second Round)

**This document was generated by _ChatGPT (model GPT-5.2 Pro, OpenAI)_ under the supervision of _Gustavo Viollaz_.**
Date: **2026-02-21**.

## 0. What Changed Since the Previous Evaluation (Why This "Second Round")

In this round we are no longer evaluating just structure and documents: there is now **more source code** inside the 2026 repo, and a **cross-verification** (Claude vs ChatGPT) against real code exists.

New inputs (within the repo):

- `research/completed/2026-02-21-arquitectura-sistema-2025.md` (Claude) — complete analysis with 23 failure points.
- `research/completed/2026-02-21-analisis-cruzado-verificacion-hipotesis.md` (Claude) — direct verification against source code.
- `research/completed/2026-02-21-mapa-prioridades-revisado.md` (Claude) — post-verification P0–P3 roadmap.
- Code migrated to `legacy/2025-season/code/` (partial):
  - `delantero/perseguir-pelota.ino` (with state machine)
  - `arquero/arquero-base.ino` (partial/incomplete)
  - `libraries/zirconLib/*` (code is present)
  - `vision-openmv/calcula-coordenadas-pelota.py` (code is present)
  - *stubs* (headers only / link to 2025 repo) in other files.

Quick conclusion: **the repo has grown and it is now possible to measure with evidence** what was real, what was hypothesis, and what parts are missing.

## 1. Real State of the Repo Today (Honest View, No Sugar-Coating)

### 1.1 Current Strengths

- **Clean structure** with 2026 intent: `software/`, `hardware/`, `testing/`, `competition/`, `research/`, `journal/`, `legacy/`.
- There is a very good "meta layer": *AI-INSTRUCTIONS* + versioned research with frontmatter and traceability.
- There is already a strong "forensic" analysis of the 2025 system and a **P0–P3 roadmap** that is coherent with what is observed in the code.

### 1.2 Current Weaknesses/Alerts

- **The codebase "that actually ran at the 2025 nationals" is NOT identified yet.**
  - This is not a detail: there are bugs in the migrated files that would make it impossible for the robot to have played as champion if those files were the actual binaries.
- The `legacy/` folder is **halfway done**: there are complete pieces (zirconLib) but also many files that are just "titles" pointing to the 2025 repo.
- In `software/` (2026) there is still no visible "executable core" (goalie/striker 2026) with tests, logging, and a robust protocol.

## 2. Evidence CONFIRMING Critical Points (and Why They Matter)

### 2.1 UART OpenMV → Teensy: Minimal and Fragile Protocol (confirmed)

The striker (`perseguir-pelota.ino`) decodes data assuming exactly 6 bytes: `[201][Xp][Yp][202][Xa][Ya]`, no checksum, no robust resynchronization.

### 2.2 CRITICAL Bug in Striker "Kick" (confirmed)

In the `PATEANDO_adelante` state, the time condition is inverted. This would cause the "kick" to turn off immediately on the first cycle. Strong evidence that **the migrated file is not the one that won**.

### 2.3 CRITICAL Bug: Goal Angle Calculated with Ball Coordinates (confirmed)

The calculation of `anguloArco` uses `(decodedYp, decodedXp)` instead of `(decodedYa, decodedXa)`. Makes `anguloArco` essentially useless.

### 2.4 BNO055 in zirconLib is "Present but Unusable" (confirmed)

`compassCalibrated` starts as `false` and is never activated. Heading always returns 0.

### 2.5 `pulseIn()` in Goalie: Hard Blocking (confirmed)

Can block for up to ~1s and is incompatible with reactive control.

### 2.6 Vision: Inconsistent and Invalid Thresholds (confirmed)

Inverted LAB thresholds (L_min > L_max) explain "mysterious" detection failures.

---

## 3. Evidence that REFUTES / ADJUSTS Points

### 3.1 Refuted: "Header/Data Collision" in UART (refuted)

The intentional design separates **data in 0–200** and **headers in 201+**. No collision risk. Protocol remains fragile for other reasons (checksum/resync).

---

## 4. NEW Findings Enabled by the New Code

### 4.1 Pin Conflict Risk in Naveen1: Possible Clash with Serial1 (new)

In Naveen1 mode, `zirconLib` may reconfigure pin 0 (RX1) as output, breaking UART. Would explain intermittent "weird UART" behaviors and PCB-switching issues.

### 4.2 Truncated Migration: Key Code Missing (new)

Files migrated as *stubs* and critical tools (calibrator) not complete. Risk of "impeccable documentation project + non-reproducible real system".

### 4.3 The Repo Does Not Yet Reflect the "Real Competition Code" (new)

P0 requirement: identify exactly which versions were compiled and uploaded in December 2025.

---

## 5. Solution Proposals (with Pros/Cons)

### 5.1 P0 — Reconstruction First

**P0.1:** Create `legacy/2025-season/competition-actual/` with EXACT files that ran.
**P0.2:** Complete migration of the 2025 repo (no stubs).

### 5.2 UART OpenMV ↔ Teensy: Three Options

**Option A** — Minimal upgrade: SOF + XOR checksum + resync.
**Option B** — Serious frame: `[SOF][LEN][TYPE][PAYLOAD...][CRC8/CRC16]` + ring buffer + timeout.
**Option C** — SLIP/COBS encoding.

Recommendation: **Option B** (Serious Frame).

### 5.3 zirconLib2: Fix HAL + Add Kinematics (P1.2)

1) Pinout safety (fix Naveen1/pin0-RX1)
2) Unified kinematics (`moveOmni(vx, vy, w)`)
3) Usable IMU (real BNO055 initialization)

### 5.4 Striker 2026: Keep FSM, But with Structure and Sensors

Modular FSM + camera/IR fusion. Camera for fine control when ball in FOV; IR 8× for 360° acquisition when not.

### 5.5 Goalie 2026: Complete Rewrite (P1.4)

"Goal line" mode + "Block" mode + non-blocking ultrasonic.

### 5.6 Vision: Stick with Blobs But with Discipline

Option A for 2026: centralized config, validated thresholds, calibration tool. ML as parallel experimental branch.

## 6. Evaluation by Areas

- **Detection**: base exists but inconsistent configuration; priority P2.2.
- **Hardware**: Dual Zircon is power and bugs; priority P1.2.
- **Localization**: IMU present but not operational; priority P2.3.
- **Control/Comms**: UART is the bottleneck; priority P1.1.
- **Strategy**: striker and goalie need separate testable behaviors; priority P1.3/P1.4.

---

## 7. Final Recommendation

1) **P0: reconstruct the real 2025 competition code**
2) **P1: UART protocol + zirconLib2 + compilable striker/goalie**
3) **P2: IR fusion + calibration + heading**
4) **P3: international 2026 requirements (comm module, capture, handle, marker)**

Without P0, everything else is engineering on sand.
